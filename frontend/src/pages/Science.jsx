        <h1>ðŸ”¬ Scientific Thinking</h1>
        <p>
          Our project follows the core steps of the <strong>scientific method</strong> to solve real-world agricultural problems using AI:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Farmers and plant owners often struggle to diagnose diseases or soil problems in their plants.</li>
          <li><strong>Question:</strong> Can AI help accurately detect plant diseases and soil issues from just an image?</li>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> We explored plant pathology, soil science, and machine learning techniques. We studied existing datasets and agricultural papers.</li>
          <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> If we train an AI on thousands of labeled plant disease images, it can learn to predict diseases accurately.</li>
          <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> We trained a deep learning model on a large dataset using image classification techniques, and tested its accuracy on new, unseen images.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> We refined the model with feedback and improved it with a second layer of analysis using GeminiPro to explain the predictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Our Plant Doctor AI successfully diagnoses plant health and explains its reasoning â€” making plant care easier and more scientific.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This integration of machine learning and scientific methodology demonstrates how technology and science work hand in hand for a more sustainable future.
